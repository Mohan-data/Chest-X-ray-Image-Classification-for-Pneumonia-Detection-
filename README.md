# Project Title
Chest X-ray Image Classification for Pneumonia Detection


## Problem Statement
Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of chest X-ray images as "Normal" or "Pneumonia" to expedite the detection and diagnosis of pneumonia, facilitating prompt medical intervention.



## Goal of this Project
The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based system that can accurately and efficiently identify cases of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. This project aims to achieve the following objectives:

Early Detection: The system should be capable of early detection of pneumonia, allowing for prompt medical intervention and treatment.

Automation: Develop an automated screening tool that reduces the need for manual interpretation of X-ray images, thereby saving time for healthcare professionals.

Accuracy: Create a deep learning model with a high level of accuracy in classifying X-ray images into "normal" or "pneumonia" categories.

Diagnostic Aid: Provide a valuable diagnostic aid that can assist radiologists and medical practitioners in making more informed decisions.

Cost-Efficiency: Contribute to cost savings in the healthcare sector by reducing the need for extensive manual review and potentially leading to early interventions that can lower treatment costs.

Scalability: Develop a scalable solution that can handle a large volume of X-ray images efficiently.

Generalization: Ensure that the model generalizes well to handle variations in X-ray image quality, positioning, and other factors.

The ultimate goal is to harness the power of deep learning to improve healthcare outcomes by aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening condition.
